            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Mode Of Payment</h2>
            <p>Hyyfam provides four payment methods through which users may request withdrawals:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Bank Transfer</li>

                Creators on Hyyfam earn commissions based on verified purchases made
                through their shared product links. All payments are processed through
                secure and authorized payment gateways. Payouts will be made directly
                to the creator’s registered bank account or preferred UPI ID, as
                provided during onboarding. Earnings are subject to the return window
                and approval process set by the partnered brands or platforms. Hyyfam
                is not responsible for payment delays caused by third-party merchants
                or incomplete user information. Minimum payout thresholds and
                processing timelines may apply and are subject to change.
            </p>
            <p>
                If suspicious or fraudulent activity is detected in a user’s account,
                Hyyfam reserves the right to indefinitely hold all payment requests
                pending further investigation or to cancel any commission accumulated
                up to that point.
